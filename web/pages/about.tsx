                Who Am I?
              </h2>
              <p className="mb-4">
                A 30 year old who has his fare share of ups and downs but
                nevertheless tries to make the best in life. A ESFJ-T (The
                Consul) if youâ€™re into the 16 personality test, and yeah, the
                type of guy who doesnâ€™t mind to talk about his feelings and
                immerses himself in conversation to understand and make human
                connection better. An inner introverted at heart but an
                extrovert when needed.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Has the tendency to compartmentalise items into their own
                individual bags, people & relationship into their own
                categories. It makes for a more organised and structured way of
                living while saving time & energy. But there are times where
                everything would just go in the total opposite direction.
